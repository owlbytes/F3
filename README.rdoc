Functional Flat Finder is a simple app that let's you view flat listings.

Each listing has a basic description of the flats, as well as a list of nearby flats based on the listing's location. 

The app used geocoder to convert latitude and longititude points into a more-friendly address for the user and the google maps api to render a static map image of the flat's location.
